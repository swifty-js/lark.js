  Authoritative reference for @lark.js/mvc (v0.0.32+, signals-only,

  frontend framework located at packages/lark-mvc — plain function
  components ((props) => JSX, body re-runs per render, hostless instances
  with NO wrapper elements), call-order-indexed hooks with NO deps arrays
  (useSignal, useRef, useComputed, useSignalEffect, useEffect is MOUNT-ONLY,

  instance), anonymous zustand-aligned createStore(creator) with
  auto-tracked computed and selector subscribe, and Vite/Webpack
  plugins with auto-injected state-preserving component HMR
  (hotSwapByComponent, registered once at the index entry). Use this skill
  whenever the user reads, writes, debugs, reviews, or extends code that
  imports from "@lark.js/mvc" (or any sub-path like /vite, /webpack,
  /jsx-runtime, /client), works under packages/lark-mvc or
  packages/lark-storybook, or mentions any of these symbols and concepts —
  render, unmount, FC, useSignal, useComputed, useSignalEffect, useEffect,
  onCleanup, createRouter, RouterView, useRouter, useBlocker, useUrlState,
  matchRoutes, RouteObject, createStore, raw, larkMvcPlugin, LarkMvcPlugin,
  hotSwapByComponent, or "why doesn't my component re-render". Even if the
  user just says "add a page/view/component to the Lark app", consult this
  skill first. Do NOT use for the removed legacy designs (defineView,
  jsxTemplate, ViewCtx, Frame/mountView/mountZone, event
  trampolines/EventDelegator, HTML-string serializer, digest/observe APIs,
  hash/hashbang routing, the Router singleton,
  Router.to/parse/diff/beforeEach/on, initRouter/resetRouter,
  useLocation/useParams/useSearchParams/useNavigate alias hooks, two-phase
  change events, the State singleton (State.get/set/clean/on/off/fire),
  Framework/Framework.boot/FrameworkConfig/getConfig/setConfig,
  useMemo/useEffect-with-deps/onMount, getCurrentInstance,
  registerComponent string routes, config.require/module-loader,
  createQuery/useQuery/createMutation/invalidateQueries,
  createService/PayloadApi, createCache/createEmitter,
  funcWithTry/assign/SignalNode) except to migrate them away — if code
  still uses them it predates the signals-only rewrite and must be
  migrated. SWR-style async server state is intentionally OUT of this
  package (future dedicated package).

# Lark Mvc Framework (`@lark.js/mvc`)

A lightweight, functional-first TypeScript framework for SPAs and
micro-frontends. Source: `packages/lark-mvc` (v0.0.32+, ESM+CJS dual build,
one runtime dependency: `@preact/signals-core`).

Core philosophy: **no `class`, no `this`, no `prototype`, no mixin — and
signals are the ONLY reactive mechanism**: no event emitters, no deps
arrays, no second dependency-tracking system, no error-swallowing wrappers
(errors bubble). Components are **React-style plain functions**
`(props) => JSX` — the body re-runs per render inside the instance's render
effect; state lives in call-order-indexed hooks. Rendering is a **hostless
VNode → DOM reconciler** (comment end-anchors, NO wrapper elements — output
DOM identical to React's). The router is a **factory**
(`createRouter(routes)`, no module singleton) mirroring react-router's data
model, with a `<RouterView/>` outlet. Cross-component state has one answer:
anonymous `createStore`. There is **no Framework/boot object, no State
singleton, no useMemo/useEffect-deps, no
Router.to/parse/beforeEach, no createQuery/createService** — all removed;
code still using them predates the rewrite and must be migrated.

## The 60-second mental model

```
render(<App/>, container)    // routed apps: render(<RouterView router={r}/>, el)
        │
every FUNCTION TAG mounts an INSTANCE (hostless — children splice directly
into the parent element, terminated by a comment end-anchor)
        │
ONE @preact/signals-core effect per instance
        │
effect run:  fn(props)  ── TRACKED: every signal read subscribes the
        │                   instance (useSignal state, props.key,
        │                   store.getState().key,
        │                   router.location/params/searchParams .value)
   slice diff (keyed)     — per-node listeners, form-state props, refs
        │
   post-commit flush ───── UNTRACKED: child instance mounts, batched
        │                  per-key prop pushes, ref calls
   flushInstanceEffects ── pending useEffect (mount) callbacks run
        │
signal / prop write ──> only SUBSCRIBED instances re-render (batch() coalesces)
```

A **component** is `function MyComp(props: P) { return <div/>; }` — used
directly as a JSX tag (`<MyComp x={1} onSave={fn}/>`). The body re-runs per
render; hooks are call-order slots (React rules of hooks). Instances are
matched across renders by function identity + `key`.

## Quick start (canonical shape)

```tsx
// src/views/user-detail.tsx
import { useSignal, useRouter } from "@lark.js/mvc";
import styles from "./user-detail.module.css";

export default function UserDetail() {
  const router = useRouter();
  const { id } = router.params.value; // "/users/:id" → tracked read
  const clicks = useSignal(0);
  return (
    <div class={styles["user"]}>
      <p>
        user {id}, clicks {clicks.value}
      </p>
      <button onClick={() => clicks.value++}>+1</button>
      <button onClick={() => router.navigate("/", { state: { from: id } })}>
        Home
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

```tsx
// src/main.tsx — routing app; plain apps just call render(<Home/>, el)
import { render, createRouter, RouterView } from "@lark.js/mvc";
import Home from "./views/home";
import UserDetail from "./views/user-detail";
import NotFound from "./views/not-found";

const router = createRouter([
  { path: "/", component: Home },
  { path: "/users/:id", component: UserDetail },
  { path: "/admin", lazy: () => import("./views/admin") }, // code splitting / MF
  { path: "*", component: NotFound },
]);
render(<RouterView router={router} />, document.getElementById("root")!);
```

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { larkMvcPlugin } from "@lark.js/mvc/vite";
export default defineConfig({ plugins: [larkMvcPlugin()] });
```

Component HMR is auto-injected — never write `import.meta.hot` boilerplate
by hand.

## Critical rules (violating these causes the classic bugs)

1. **The component body IS the tracked region** — it re-runs per render;
   reading a signal, `props.key`, store state, or
   `router.location.value`/`router.params.value` in it subscribes the
   instance. Event handlers and async callbacks read snapshots (no
   subscription).
2. **Rules of hooks (React)** — the body re-runs, so hooks must run
   unconditionally, in the same order, at the top level. `useSignal(initial)`
   returns the SAME signal every render; a plain `signal()` in the body
   would be recreated per render (footgun — always use `useSignal` for
   instance state). Hook-count changes between renders dev-warn and reset
   trailing slots.
3. **NO deps arrays** — there is no `useMemo` and no `useEffect(fn, deps)`.
   Derive with `useComputed(fn)` (auto-tracked); run reactive side effects
   with `useSignalEffect(fn)` (auto-tracked, created once); `useEffect(fn)`
   is MOUNT-ONLY (runs once post-commit, returned fn = unmount cleanup).
4. **Shallow reactivity** — signals compare by reference (`===`).
   `list.value.push(x)` renders nothing; write `list.value = [...list.value, x]`.
   Same rule for `store.setState` and props.
5. **Never write a signal the same body/computed reads** — that is a cycle
   (`Cycle detected`). Derive with `useComputed`; write from event handlers
   or `useSignalEffect` with disjoint reads.
6. **Callbacks are plain props** (React semantics) — child calls
   `props.onSelect?.(data)` directly; there is no emitter, no fire(), no
   trampoline. Call callbacks from handlers (reading one in the BODY
   subscribes to its identity).
7. **`children` arrive as `props.children`**; `key` is a vnode-level sibling
   compare key (never a DOM id) — on component tags it preserves the
   INSTANCE (and its hook state) across reorders. `class`/`style`/`id`/`ref`
   on a component tag are ordinary props the component must apply itself
   (hostless — there is no host element to route them to).
8. **Routing is a factory** — `const router = createRouter(routes, {basename?})`
   (react-router data model, history-only, per-instance state);
   `<RouterView router={router}/>` is the outlet; `useRouter()` resolves the
   ACTIVE (last-created) router; guard with `router.block(fn)` /
   `useBlocker(fn)`. Components read `router.params.value` etc. directly —
   there are NO useLocation/useParams alias hooks. `useUrlState(defaults)`
   returns `[value, setValue]` (value tracked, setter slot-stable,
   component-only).
9. **Errors bubble** — no try-catch wrappers, no error sink, no
   config.error. A throw in a body/effect/handler propagates to the signal
   write site; lazy-route failures are unhandled rejections.
10. **Cross-component state = `createStore(creator)`** (anonymous, zustand
    semantics) — there is no State singleton. Keyed lists need stable
    `key`s; strings are TEXT everywhere (`raw(html)` is the only
    trusted-HTML path); routes hold component REFERENCES or `lazy()`
    loaders (no string registry).
