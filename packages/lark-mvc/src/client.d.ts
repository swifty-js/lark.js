/**
 * Ambient type declarations for Lark Mvc's DOM and module augmentations.
 *
 * Lark attaches metadata to DOM elements (frame references, compare-key
 * caches, range-event tags) and relies on the `import.meta.hot` HMR context.
 * This file declares those augmentations so application TypeScript code can
 * access them without `as any` casts.
 *
 * Also declares module types for `*.html` (compiled template functions) and
 * `*.css` imports so bundlers resolve them correctly.
