/**
 * Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for function components.
 *
 * `hotSwapByComponent(oldFn, newFn)` hot-swaps component code without a full
 * page reload, preserving instance state across updates:
 *
 * 1. `aliasComponent(old, new)` — parents (or route tables) holding the
 *    STALE import keep matching live instances (the reconciler compares
 *    canonical identities).
 * 2. Every live instance of the old function is swapped in place
 *    (`swapInstanceFn`): plain state slots (`useSignal` / `useRef`) survive;
 *    closure-bound slots (effects, computeds, memos, queries) are disposed
 *    and recreated by the next render so no stale closures linger. The
 *    instance then re-renders via its `invalidate` signal.
 *
 * The swap function is exposed on `globalThis.__lark_hmr__` so auto-injected
 * HMR snippets (see ./hmr-inject.ts) can call it WITHOUT importing
 * "@lark.js/mvc" — under Module Federation any import of the shared singleton
 * inside an HMR callback registers the module as a shared consumer, which
 * makes webpack expect a main-chunk hot-update it never emits
 * (ChunkLoadError). The global sidesteps module resolution entirely.
