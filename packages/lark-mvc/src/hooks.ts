/**
 * Hooks for function components (React rules of hooks, signals-only).
 *
 * The component function re-runs on EVERY render pass, so hooks are
 * call-order-indexed slots on the current instance: call them
 * unconditionally, in the same order, at the top level of the component body
 * — never inside conditions, loops, or event handlers.
 *
 * Signals are the SINGLE dependency-tracking mechanism — there are NO deps
 * arrays anywhere:
 * - derive values with `useComputed` (auto-tracked, lazy)
 * - run reactive side effects with `useSignalEffect` (auto-tracked)
 * - run one-time post-commit setup with `useEffect` (mount-only; cleanup on
 *   unmount)
 * - register teardown with `onCleanup`
 * - `useSignal(initial)` returns a stable `Signal` — write `sig.value` from
 *   handlers, read it in JSX. Only readers of that signal re-render.
