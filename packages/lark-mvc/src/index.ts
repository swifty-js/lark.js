/**
 * Lark Framework — public API barrel export.
 *
 * Re-exports the complete public surface of `@lark.js/mvc` from a single
 * entry point. Consumers can `import { render, useSignal, createRouter, ... }`
 * from `"@lark.js/mvc"` without knowing the internal module layout.
 *
 * ## API surface
 *
 * | Category | Exports |
 * | -------- | ------- |
 * | Reactive | `signal`, `computed`, `effect`, `batch`, `untracked`, `Signal` |
 * | Rendering | `render`, `unmount`, `raw`, `Fragment` |
 * | Hooks | `useSignal`, `useRef`, `useComputed`, `useSignalEffect`, `useEffect` (mount-only), `onCleanup` |
 * | Router | `createRouter`, `RouterView`, `useRouter`, `useBlocker`, `matchPath`, `matchRoutes` |
 * | State | `createStore`, `useUrlState` |
 * | HMR | `hotSwapByComponent` |
 * | Types | All types from `./types` via `export *` |
 *
 * There is no Framework/boot object — an app boots with:
 * `render(<RouterView router={createRouter(routes)}/>, container)`.
 * Async server state (SWR-style queries) is intentionally NOT part of this
 * package — it belongs to a dedicated data-fetching package built on the
 * same signals.

// Global HMR handle — THE single registration point. Auto-injected HMR
// snippets (see ./hmr-inject.ts) call it via `globalThis.__lark_hmr__`

// would register the module as an MF shared consumer → ChunkLoadError).

// writes re-render synchronously (batched inside `batch()`).

// no deps arrays)

// Router (factory-based, history-only, react-router data model on signals)
