/**
 * Larky type definitions.
 *
 * This module is the **single source of truth** for all shared types across
 * the framework. Defining them here (rather than inline in each module)
 * enforces a consistent interface contract and prevents circular type imports.
 *
 * ## Framework architecture
 *
 * Larky is a lightweight React-style frontend framework for single-page
 * applications:
 *
 * - **Component** — plain function components `(props) => JSXNode` (`FC<P>`),
 *   mounted hostless by the VNode reconciler; state via hooks. Function
 *   components ONLY — there are no class components.
 * - **Router** — `createRouter(routes)` factory (no module singleton):
 *   history-only, aligned with react-router's DATA MODE — a `location`
 *   signal, ranked `:param`/`*` route matching, `navigate`, async blockers,
 *   `<RouterView/>` outlet
 * - **Store** — zustand-aligned state management with `createStore` /
 *   `getState` / `setState` / `subscribe` / `computed`
 *
 * ## Design principles
 *
 * - Functional API — no `class`, no `this`, no `prototype`, no `mixin`
 * - Fine-grained reactivity (`@vue/reactivity`) — read = subscribe,
 *   write = re-render (microtask-batched). Signals are the ONLY notification
 *   mechanism — no `useState`, no deps arrays, no event emitters.
 * - Direct VNode → DOM reconciliation (hostless component instances, keyed
 *   diff, per-node event listeners). No Fiber, no SSR.
