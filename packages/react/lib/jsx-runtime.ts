/**
 * JSX automatic runtime (`jsxImportSource: "@lark.js/react"`).
 *
 * Runtime: `jsx`/`jsxs` build VNode descriptors; the incoming props object is
 * used verbatim (the compiler owns it — it may be frozen and MUST NOT be
 * mutated or copied). `children` stays inside props; `key` arrives as the
 * third argument.
 *
 * Types: the JSX namespace is DERIVED from `@types/react` (a types-only
 * dependency — the runtime never imports "react") with two adaptations:
 *   1. event handlers receive NATIVE events — every
 *      `(event: SyntheticEvent) => void` prop is remapped to
 *      `(event: NativeEvent & { currentTarget: TTag }) => void`;
 *   2. `ref` accepts this framework's `Ref<T>` (object ref, or callback ref
 *      optionally returning a cleanup — React 19 semantics).
 * Everything else (per-tag attributes, aria-*, data-*, CSSProperties, svg /
 * mathml tags) comes from `@types/react` unchanged.
